### NEAT for Reinforcement Learning on the OpenAI Gym

This project applies Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies ([NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) on a number of [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) Reinforcement Learning scenarios. The intention is to provide comparisons and experimental insights into the performance and viability of using NEAT for Reinforcement Learning tasks.
